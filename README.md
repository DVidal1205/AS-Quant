AS-Quant generates the expression level of alternative splicing among two different biological conditions.

# Installation
AS-Quant tool can be downloaded directly from github. Users need to have python3 installed on their machine. It can work on both Windows and Linux platforms.

Users need to run the as-quant.py file in order to demonstrate the AS events.

$python3 as_quant.py

To generate plots for specific splicing event, users need to run make_plots.py and provide input in a specific pattern: chrom:gene:start-end

$python3 make_plots.py

# User manual
User manual for AS-Quant is available on github https://github.com/compbiolabucf/AS-Quant/blob/master/AS-Quant%20User%20Manual.pdf

# Sample data
AS-Quant example data for mouse(mouse mm10) is included in the folder https://github.com/compbiolabucf/AS-Quant/tree/master/Sample_input_mouse. To run from scratch, user can use the sample data for quantization of AS events.
